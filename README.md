"The jBPT code library is a compendium of process technologies, i.e., a concise but comprehensive collection of techniques for process model analysis that support research on the design, execution, and evaluation of processes. The idea originated from observations on the evolution of process-related research disciplines. The library offers a broad range of basis analysis and utility functionality and, due to its open publishing model, can easily be extended."
