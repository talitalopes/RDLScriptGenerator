RDL Script Generator
=========

Project to create RDL scripts from XPDL projects. It uses the jbpt lib to create a RPST which can be traversed to discover sequences and loops. The algorithm to create the RPST does not have good results when dealing with unstructured processes.

The jBPT lib can be found at https://code.google.com/p/jbpt/

"The jBPT code library is a compendium of process technologies, i.e., a concise but comprehensive collection of techniques for process model analysis that support research on the design, execution, and evaluation of processes. The idea originated from observations on the evolution of process-related research disciplines. The library offers a broad range of basis analysis and utility functionality and, due to its open publishing model, can easily be extended."
